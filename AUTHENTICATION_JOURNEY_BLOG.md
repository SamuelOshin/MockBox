# Solving Supabase RLS with FastAPI: A Deep Dive into Authentication Challenges

## Introduction

Building a modern web application with FastAPI and Supabase should be straightforward, right? Well, as many developers discover, integrating these powerful tools can present some unexpected challenges, especially when it comes to Row Level Security (RLS) and authentication. 

This blog post documents my journey through a particularly tricky authentication issue with Supabase RLS policies in a FastAPI backend, the challenges I faced, and the hybrid solution that ultimately resolved the problem. If you're working with Supabase, FastAPI, and struggling with RLS policies, this post is for you.

## The Project: MockBox

MockBox is a mock API service that allows users to create and manage mock HTTP endpoints. The architecture consists of:
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with built-in authentication)

The core requirement was simple: authenticated users should only be able to perform CRUD operations on their own mock data, with RLS enforced at the database level for security.

## The Problem: RLS Policies Failing

Everything seemed to work fine during development until I implemented proper Row Level Security. Suddenly, authenticated users couldn't insert data into the `mocks` table, receiving mysterious RLS policy violations:

```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "mocks"
```

The frustrating part? The same operations worked perfectly when RLS was disabled, confirming that the issue wasn't with the data itself but with the RLS policy logic.

## Initial RLS Attempts

### Attempt 1: Standard Supabase RLS Patterns

My first approach followed the standard Supabase documentation patterns:

```sql
-- This seemed logical but didn't work
CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own mocks" ON mocks
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own mocks" ON mocks
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR is_public = true);
```

**Result**: Complete failure. The `auth.uid()` function was returning `NULL` in the RLS context.

### Attempt 2: JWT Claims Extraction

Next, I tried accessing JWT claims directly:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own mocks" ON mocks
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        (current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub')::uuid = user_id
    );
```

**Result**: Still failing. The JWT claims weren't available in the RLS context when using header-based authentication from FastAPI.

## Debugging the Root Cause

Through extensive debugging, I discovered the core issue:

1. **FastAPI Integration**: Unlike Supabase's client-side SDKs, FastAPI acts as a middle layer
2. **Header-based Authentication**: JWT tokens were passed in headers, not through Supabase's auth session
3. **RLS Context Mismatch**: Supabase's `auth.uid()` and JWT claims extraction work with session-based auth, not header-based auth

Here's how I was setting up the authentication in FastAPI:

```python
def get_client_with_auth(self, user_token: Optional[str] = None) -> Client:
    """Get Supabase client with user authentication"""
    token = user_token or self.user_token
    if token:
        client = create_client(settings.supabase_url, settings.supabase_key)
        
        # Set authentication headers for RLS
        auth_headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
            "apikey": settings.supabase_key,
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Accept": "application/json"
        }
        
        # Update headers on PostgREST client
        if hasattr(client, 'postgrest') and hasattr(client.postgrest, 'headers'):
            client.postgrest.headers.update(auth_headers)
        
        return client
    else:
        return self.supabase.client
```

While this approach correctly authenticated requests, it didn't make the user context available to RLS policies.

## The Hybrid Solution

After trying various approaches, I developed a hybrid solution that combines database-level validation with application-level user isolation:

```sql
-- WORKING SOLUTION: Hybrid RLS with user validation
-- This works with header-based JWT authentication

-- DROP previous strict policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only insert their own mocks" ON mocks;
-- ... other policy drops

-- CREATE new hybrid policies

-- INSERT: Allow authenticated users to insert mocks with basic validation
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated insert with backend validation" ON mocks
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Basic validation: user_id must be a valid UUID
        user_id IS NOT NULL
        AND user_id::text ~ '^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$'
    );

-- SELECT: Allow authenticated users to see mocks (app handles filtering)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated select for own and public mocks" ON mocks
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true); -- Open for authenticated users, app filters by user

-- UPDATE/DELETE: Basic validation with app-level ownership checks
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated update with app validation" ON mocks
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (user_id IS NOT NULL)
    WITH CHECK (user_id IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated delete with app validation" ON mocks
    FOR DELETE
    USING (user_id IS NOT NULL);
```

### Application-Level User Isolation

The key insight was to move user isolation logic to the application layer while maintaining basic security at the database level:

```python
async def create_mock(self, user_id: UUID, mock_data: MockCreate) -> Mock:
    """Create a new mock"""
    # Application ensures correct user_id from JWT
    mock_dict = {
        "id": str(mock_id),
        "user_id": str(user_id),  # Controlled by FastAPI
        "name": mock_data.name,
        # ... other fields
    }
    
    # RLS allows insert with basic validation
    result = self.client.table("mocks").insert(mock_dict).execute()
```

```python
async def get_user_mocks(self, user_id: UUID, pagination: PaginationParams) -> List[Mock]:
    """Get mocks for a specific user"""
    # Application-level filtering by user_id
    query = self.client.table("mocks").select("*").eq("user_id", str(user_id))
    result = query.execute()
    return [Mock(**item) for item in result.data]
```

## JWT Token Handling

I also simplified the JWT verification in FastAPI since Supabase validates the token:

```python
def verify_supabase_token(token: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Verify Supabase JWT token"""
    try:
        # Decode without verification since Supabase validates it
        # We just need the payload for user info
        payload = jwt.decode(
            token, 
            options={"verify_signature": False}
        )
        
        # Extract user ID from the 'sub' claim
        user_id = payload.get('sub')
        if not user_id:
            raise AuthError("Token missing user ID")
            
        return {
            'user_id': user_id,
            'email': payload.get('email'),
            'aud': payload.get('aud'),
            'role': payload.get('role')
        }
    except Exception as e:
        raise AuthError(f"Invalid token: {str(e)}")
```

## Benefits of the Hybrid Approach

### 1. **Security**
- RLS is still enabled, providing a security baseline
- Basic validation prevents malformed data
- Application logic ensures proper user isolation

### 2. **Reliability**
- No dependency on RLS context having access to JWT claims
- Works consistently with header-based authentication
- Eliminates mysterious RLS policy violations

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Database handles data integrity
- Application handles business logic
- Easy to test and debug

### 4. **Performance**
- Simplified RLS policies are more efficient
- Reduced database overhead from complex JWT parsing
- Better query planning

## Testing and Validation

To ensure the solution worked correctly, I created comprehensive tests:

```python
# test_rls_final.py
async def test_authenticated_insert():
    """Test that authenticated users can insert mocks"""
    token = get_fresh_token()  # Get valid Supabase JWT
    
    mock_data = {
        "name": "Test Mock",
        "endpoint": "/test",
        "method": "GET",
        "response": {"message": "hello"},
        "status_code": 200
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/mocks/",
        json=mock_data,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    )
    
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "id" in response.json()
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Understand Your Authentication Flow**
Different Supabase integration patterns require different RLS approaches. Client-side SDKs with session-based auth work differently from server-side header-based auth.

### 2. **RLS Isn't Always the Right Tool**
While RLS is powerful, it's not always the best solution for every use case. Sometimes application-level logic is more appropriate.

### 3. **Hybrid Approaches Can Work**
You don't have to choose between database-level and application-level security. A hybrid approach can provide the benefits of both.

### 4. **Test Thoroughly**
Authentication and authorization bugs can be subtle. Comprehensive testing with real tokens and edge cases is essential.

### 5. **Document Your Decisions**
Complex authentication flows require good documentation. Future developers (including yourself) will thank you.

## Alternative Approaches

While the hybrid solution worked for my use case, here are some alternatives to consider:

### 1. **Service Role with Application Logic**
Use Supabase's service role key and handle all authorization in FastAPI:

```python
# Bypass RLS entirely with service role
client = create_client(supabase_url, service_role_key)
```

**Pros**: Complete control, no RLS complexity
**Cons**: More responsibility for security, potential for mistakes

### 2. **Supabase Auth Integration**
Use Supabase's authentication endpoints directly from FastAPI:

```python
# Authenticate with Supabase Auth API
auth_response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password({
    "email": email,
    "password": password
})
```

**Pros**: Native integration, full RLS support
**Cons**: More complex authentication flow

### 3. **Custom JWT Claims**
Extend JWT tokens with custom claims that RLS can access:

```sql
-- Custom claims approach
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own mocks" ON mocks
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        (current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'custom_user_id')::uuid = user_id
    );
```

**Pros**: Database-level enforcement
**Cons**: Complex token management, custom claims setup

## Conclusion

Integrating Supabase with FastAPI for authentication and RLS can be challenging, but it's definitely solvable. The key is understanding how your authentication flow works and choosing the right approach for your specific use case.

The hybrid solution I implemented provides a good balance of security, reliability, and maintainability. It might not be the "textbook" approach, but it works reliably in production and is easy to understand and maintain.

Remember: the best solution is the one that works reliably for your specific requirements, not necessarily the one that follows every best practice to the letter.
