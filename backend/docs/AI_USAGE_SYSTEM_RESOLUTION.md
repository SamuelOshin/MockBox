# MockBox AI Usage System - Error Documentation and Resolution

## Executive Summary

This document details the complete resolution of AI usage limits, quota display, and user plan assignment issues in the MockBox application. All core functionality is now working correctly with robust error handling and proper authentication.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Backend Authentication Key Issue**

**Problem**: Backend was using the anonymous Supabase key instead of the service role key for admin operations.

**Symptoms**:
- Users couldn't access plan information
- RLS policies blocked backend operations
- Frontend displayed "No plan assigned" errors
- Backend couldn't read/write to `user_plans`, `profiles`, and `ai_usage_stats` tables

**Root Cause**: 
- `.env` file had incorrect `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (contained spaces, wrong value)
- `config.py` didn't require the service role key
- `DatabaseManager` wasn't using admin privileges for plan/profile operations

**Fix**:
1. Updated `.env` with correct service role key
2. Made `supabase_service_role_key` required in `config.py`
3. Added `admin_client` to `DatabaseManager` using service role key
4. Updated all admin operations to use `admin_client`

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/.env`
- `backend/app/core/config.py`
- `backend/app/core/database.py`

### 2. **Missing User Plans and Profiles**

**Problem**: New and existing users had missing or inaccessible plan assignments.

**Symptoms**:
- Users showed as having no plan
- Quota information couldn't be retrieved
- AI usage limits weren't enforced
- Frontend quota display failed

**Root Cause**:
- RLS policies prevented backend from reading user plans with anon key
- Missing automatic plan assignment for new users
- Orphaned profiles without valid plan references

**Fix**:
1. Updated `get_user_plan_and_quota()` to use admin client
2. Added automatic Free plan assignment for users without plans
3. Enhanced `_create_profile_with_free_plan()` method
4. Ensured usage stats creation alongside profile creation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/core/database.py`
- `backend/migrations/006_fix_user_profiles_and_usage.sql`

### 3. **Usage Statistics Access Issues**

**Problem**: Backend couldn't read or write AI usage statistics due to RLS restrictions.

**Symptoms**:
- Usage tracking didn't work
- Rate limiting failed
- Frontend couldn't display current usage
- No quota enforcement

**Root Cause**:
- `get_usage_stats_for_user()` used wrong client (anon key)
- `upsert_usage_stats_for_user()` couldn't write to database
- Missing fallback handling for non-existent usage records

**Fix**:
1. Updated usage functions to use admin client by default
2. Added proper error handling for missing records
3. Enhanced usage stats creation with robust fallbacks
4. Fixed rate limit calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/core/database.py`

### 4. **Plan Assignment Method Issues**

**Problem**: `assign_free_plan_to_user()` used anon key instead of admin privileges.

**Symptoms**:
- Couldn't create profiles for new users
- Plan assignments failed silently
- Manual plan changes didn't work

**Root Cause**:
- Method used `self.supabase.client` (anon key) instead of `self.admin_client`
- Missing error handling for plan lookup failures

**Fix**:
1. Updated method to use `admin_client` exclusively
2. Added comprehensive error handling
3. Ensured usage stats creation alongside plan assignment

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/core/database.py`

## Code Changes Summary

### Configuration Updates

```python
# config.py - Made service role key required
supabase_service_role_key: str = Field(..., description="Supabase service role key")
```

### Database Manager Enhancements

```python
# database.py - Added admin client
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, user_token: Optional[str] = None):
        self.supabase = SupabaseClient()
        self.user_token = user_token
        # Admin client for operations that require service role
        self.admin_client = create_client(
            settings.supabase_url, 
            settings.supabase_service_role_key
        )
```

### Plan and Profile Management

- Service role key used for admin operations
- Robust error handling with fallbacks
- Complete quota data available for frontend

### Frontend Integration
- `useAIGeneration` hook receives properly formatted data
- Quota display shows accurate information
- Rate limiting enforced correctly
- No authentication errors

## Optional Next Steps

### 1. Database Trigger for Automatic Plan Assignment (Recommended)

Add a PostgreSQL trigger to automatically create profiles when users sign up:

```sql
-- Create function to handle new user registration
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user() 
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    free_plan_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Get Free plan ID
    SELECT id INTO free_plan_id 
    FROM user_plans 
    WHERE name = 'Free' 
    LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Create profile with Free plan
    INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, plan_id)
    VALUES (NEW.id, free_plan_id);
    
    -- Create usage stats record
    INSERT INTO ai_usage_stats (user_id)
    VALUES (NEW.id);
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create trigger on auth.users table
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
    AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates race conditions
- Ensures all users always have plans
- Reduces backend complexity
- Database-level consistency

### 2. Frontend UI/UX Enhancements

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

async def get_user_plan_and_quota(self, user_id: UUID):
    with logger.bind(user_id=str(user_id)):
        logger.info("Fetching user plan", operation="get_plan")
        # ... existing code ...
```

**Error Metrics**:
- Track plan assignment failures
- Monitor quota enforcement errors
- Alert on repeated authentication issues

### 5. Performance Optimizations

**Caching Strategy**:
```python
# Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
import redis

class CachedDatabaseManager(DatabaseManager):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.cache = redis.Redis()
    
    async def get_user_plan_and_quota(self, user_id: UUID):
        cache_key = f"plan:{user_id}"
        cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return json.loads(cached)
        
        result = await super().get_user_plan_and_quota(user_id)
        self.cache.setex(cache_key, 300, json.dumps(result))  # 5min cache
        return result
```

**Database Optimizations**:
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields
- Optimize RLS policies for performance
- Consider read replicas for analytics

### 6. Security Enhancements

**Audit Logging**:
```python
# Track sensitive operations
async def audit_log(self, user_id: UUID, action: str, details: dict):
    await self.admin_client.table("audit_logs").insert({
        "user_id": str(user_id),
        "action": action,
        "details": details,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "ip_address": self.request_ip
    }).execute()
```

**Rate Limiting Improvements**:
- Sliding window rate limiting
- Different limits per plan tier
- Temporary limit increases for burst usage

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

**Automated Testing**:
```python
# Add comprehensive test suite
class TestAIUsageSystem:
    async def test_new_user_plan_assignment(self):
        """Test automatic plan assignment for new users"""
        
    async def test_quota_enforcement(self):
        """Test rate limiting and quota enforcement"""
        
    async def test_plan_upgrades(self):
        """Test plan change scenarios"""
```

**Load Testing**:
- Test system under high concurrent usage
